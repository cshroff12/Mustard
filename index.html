                    <h2>What is Mustard</h2>
                    <p class="description">Mustard is a condiment made from the seeds of a mustard plant, which may be the white/yellow mustard (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_mustard" target="_blank">Sinapis alba</a>), brown mustard (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassica_juncea" target="_blank">Brassica juncea</a>), or black mustard (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamphospermum_nigrum" target="_blank">Rhamphospermum nigrum</a>).</p>
                    <p class="description">The whole, ground, cracked, or bruised mustard seeds are mixed with water, vinegar, lemon juice, wine, or other liquids, salt, and often other flavorings and spices, to create a paste or sauce ranging in color from bright yellow to dark brown. The seed itself has a strong, pungent, and somewhat bitter taste. The taste of mustard condiments ranges from sweet to spicy.</p>

                    <h2>History of Mustard</h2>
                    <p class="description">Mustard is one of the oldest known condiments in human history — used for thousands of years across multiple civilizations. Yellow mustard paste originated in China during the <a alt="Zhou Dynasty" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty" target="_blank">Zhou dynasty</a> (1046–256 BC), when the mustard seeds were ground and made into paste. It was often used in the royal courts during the Zhou Dynasty to help whet the appetite for the later courses in a meal.</p>
                    <p class="description">The use of mustard as a hot dog condiment is said to have been first seen in the United States at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, when the bright-yellow French's mustard was introduced by the R.T. French Company.</p>

                    <h2>Who is Mustard?</h2>
                    <p class="description">Dijon Isaiah McFarlane (born June 5, 1990), known professionally as Mustard, is an American record producer. A frequent collaborator of fellow California-based artists YG and Ty Dolla Sign, he began his career producing singles and albums for both rappers, and has since done so for other prominent acts in hip-hop and R&B.</p>
                    <p>Mustard's production style has been described as up-tempo and club-oriented, but also rudimentary and melodic. Most of his works begin or end with the producer tag "Mustard on the beat, ho!" One of his most recent and popular productions was the beat of Kendrick Lamar's <i>TV Off</i> in which Kendrick yells his name </p><h1>MUSTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD</h1>
                    <h1>DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD</h1>
